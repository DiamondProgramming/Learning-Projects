# üöÄ Learning-Projects üöÄ

---

Welcome to `Learning-Projects`! This repository is my personal space for exploring and mastering various technologies and programming concepts. Here, you'll find a collection of diverse projects, each designed to enhance my tech stack and deepen my understanding of different fields within computer science, mainly data science.

## üéØ Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to serve as a hands-on learning environment. Each project, big or small, aims to achieve one or more of the following:

* **Learn new programming languages or frameworks.**
* **Explore different paradigms** like object-oriented programming, functional programming, etc.
* **Dive into specific domains** such as:
    * **Machine Learning (ML)** and Artificial Intelligence (AI)
    * **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** development
    * **Web Development** (frontend and backend)
    * **Data Science** and analysis
    * **Game Development**
    * **Cloud Computing**
    * ...and more!
* **Strengthen problem-solving skills** through practical application.
* **Document my learning journey** and progress.

## üìÅ Repository Structure

Projects are organized into distinct folders, typically named after the technology or concept being learned. Each project folder will ideally contain:

* **Source Code:** The core of the project.
* **`README.md`:** A dedicated `README` explaining the project's purpose, technologies used, how to run it, and any key learnings or challenges.
* **`requirements.txt` (if applicable):** For Python projects, listing dependencies.
* **Screenshots/Gifs (if applicable):** Visuals of the project in action.

## ‚ú® Projects

Here are some of the types of projects you can expect to find (and what I'm currently working on or planning to explore!):

* **Machine Learning:** Small models for classification, regression, or even basic neural networks.
* **GUI Applications:** Simple desktop applications using frameworks like Tkinter, PyQt, or similar.
* **Web Applications:** Basic front-end designs, simple backend APIs, or full-stack mini-applications.
* **Data Analysis Scripts:** Scripts to process, analyze, and visualize data.
* **Algorithm Implementations:** Reimplementations of classic algorithms and data structures.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Concepts I'm Exploring (and hope to add projects for!)

* **Languages:** Python (primary), JavaScript, Java, C++, Go, Rust
* **Web Frameworks:** Flask, Django, React, Node.js, Express.js
* **ML Libraries:** scikit-learn, TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch
* **GUI Frameworks:** Tkinter, PyQt, Kivy, Streamlit
* **Databases:** SQL (PostgreSQL, MySQL, BigQuery), NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis)
* **Cloud Platforms:** AWS, Google Cloud, Azure
* **DevOps Tools:** Docker, Git, CI/CD basics

## ü§ù Contributing & Feedback

Since this is a personal learning repository, I'm not actively seeking external contributions for the code itself. However, I welcome and appreciate any feedback, suggestions, or constructive criticism! If you have ideas for projects, resources, or better ways to approach a problem, please feel free to open an issue or reach out.
